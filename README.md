# Now-Namespace
Description of the 'Now' RSS namespace

## About

The 'now' namespace is intended to allow for the sharing of updates via RSS that do not relate to traditional items, e.g. blog posts. It takes it's name from the [/now page concept](https://nownownow.com/about) created by Derek Sivers.

The namespace will allow for additional channel level elements to share updates similar to the contents of a now page.

This is an initial version of the 'now' namespace - published 24th Jan 2023.

### Example feeds
